#Functionality
Using this screen an admin can see the list of users in the system and create a new user.
- 'New User' button: Opens up the form to create a new user. (?)
- 'Hide Disabled User' checkbox: When checked it hides the users in the table which has the 'Enabled' column value as false.
- 'Save User' button: It is non-clickable when the new user form's fields are empty. When the fields are filled it is back to being clickable and has the same colour as the other button. It saves a new user or saves the edits of the chosen user.
- User Table: It is possible the scroll in the table. It is also possible to sort them according to one of the columns.
